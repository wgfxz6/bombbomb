# BombBomb Video Messaging: Stand Out in Crowded Inboxes, Build Real Relationships, Close Deals Faster

You know that feeling when you send an important email and it just... disappears into the void? No response. No acknowledgment. Just radio silence.

Here's the thing: people are drowning in text-based emails. The average professional gets 121 emails per day, and most of them look exactly the same—boring blocks of text that nobody wants to read.

BombBomb figured out a simple solution. Instead of typing another forgettable email, you record a quick video. Suddenly, you're not just another name in someone's inbox—you're a real person with a face, a voice, and personality.

The results speak for themselves. BombBomb users see 81% higher email open rates and 67% more lead conversions. Video messaging reduces the touches needed to close a deal by 70%. That's not incremental improvement—that's a complete game-changer.

## What Actually Is BombBomb?

BombBomb is a video messaging platform that lets you record, send, and track personalized videos through email, text, and social media. Think of it as your secret weapon for cutting through digital noise.

The platform launched back in 2006, which means they've spent nearly two decades perfecting video messaging. Over 45,000 business professionals use it daily—from real estate agents and mortgage brokers to sales teams and customer success managers.

The core idea is stupidly simple: replace text-only communication with quick video messages. You hit record, say what you need to say, and send it off. The recipient gets an email with an animated preview of your video, making it impossible to ignore.

## Why Video Messaging Actually Works

Let's be honest—nobody trusts faceless communication anymore. When someone gets a text-only email from a stranger, their first instinct is to ignore it or mark it as spam.

But when that same email starts with your face on camera? Everything changes. You become human. The message feels personal. Trust happens faster.

This isn't just theory. The data backs it up. Video emails generate responses 5x more frequently than plain text. They get opened twice as often. People actually watch them instead of skimming and deleting.

Sales teams love BombBomb because it accelerates the entire pipeline. Instead of playing phone tag or writing paragraph after paragraph explaining something complex, you just show them. One 30-second video does what three follow-up emails couldn't.

Customer service teams use it to humanize support interactions. Instead of canned responses that sound like they came from a robot, customers get a real person explaining the solution with empathy and clarity.

## The Platform Features That Matter

BombBomb isn't trying to be a full-featured video production studio. It focuses on speed and simplicity—getting you from "I need to send this" to "message sent" as fast as possible.

**Recording is brain-dead simple.** Click the record button in Gmail, Outlook, or the Chrome extension. Your camera turns on. You talk. You're done. The video uploads and encodes while you're still recording, so there's zero wait time.

**You can record your face, your screen, or both.** This flexibility matters. Sometimes you need to walk someone through a spreadsheet while narrating. Sometimes you just want to deliver a personal message. BombBomb handles both scenarios.

**The tracking features are borderline creepy (in a good way).** You get real-time notifications when someone opens your email, plays your video, and clicks any links. You can see exactly how much of the video they watched. This intelligence lets you follow up at the perfect moment.

**Brand customization keeps everything professional.** Add your logo to video player pages. Customize colors to match your company. Include clickable calls-to-action right in the video. Everything stays on-brand without extra effort.

**Analytics give you the full picture.** Beyond individual video tracking, you get team performance dashboards. See who's actually using video, which messages perform best, and how your overall strategy is working.

## BombBomb Engage vs. Classic BombBomb

Here's something that confuses people: BombBomb now has two platforms.

The original BombBomb (with Essentials and Plus plans) focuses heavily on marketing automation features. It's built for complex campaigns with sophisticated email sequences and marketing tools.

BombBomb Engage is the newer platform designed specifically for sales teams and businesses that prioritize personalized video outreach over marketing automation. It features a redesigned interface, faster performance, deeper analytics, and enterprise-grade security.

The key differentiator is Copilot—an AI-powered automation system available on Engage plans. Copilot ensures every prospect gets video by using smart team assignments and fallback logic. If one rep doesn't complete their assignment, Copilot automatically reassigns it.

Essentials customers can easily upgrade to Engage. Plus customers who rely on advanced marketing tools will keep their current features until Engage adds comparable functionality.

## BombBomb Pricing: What You Actually Pay

Let's cut through the marketing speak and talk real numbers.

BombBomb offers three main pricing tiers for their Engage platform:

| Plan | Monthly Billing | Annual Billing | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Core** | $42/user/month | $36/user/month | Teams getting started with video messaging |
| **Core + Copilot** | $70/user/month | $56/user/month | Teams needing systematic adoption and automation |
| **Enterprise** | Custom pricing | Custom pricing | Large teams with security and compliance requirements |

**The annual billing discount is legit.** You save 14-20% by paying annually instead of monthly. For a five-person team on Core + Copilot, that's about $840 saved per year.

### Core Plan ($42/month or $36/month annually)

This gets you the fundamentals:
- Unlimited video messages with no storage limits
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Browser extensions for Chrome and Edge
- Email integrations with Gmail and Outlook
- Quick video editing tools (trim, stitch, custom thumbnails)
- Custom branding on video player pages
- SOC 2 Type II secure hosting
- Viewer engagement analytics

For solo users or small teams just dipping their toes into video messaging, Core handles the basics without overwhelming you with features you won't use.

### Core + Copilot ($70/month or $56/month annually)

This is where things get interesting. Everything from Core, plus:
- AI creation tools (speaker notes, summaries, titles, noise reduction)
- Smart team assignments that ensure prospects get contacted
- Suggested scripts and example videos to help reps succeed
- Patented fallback video logic (auto-reassignment if someone drops the ball)
- CRM integrations (Microsoft Dynamics, Outreach, Total Expert)
- Automated workflows for consistent outreach
- Team analytics dashboard

The Copilot features solve the biggest problem with video messaging: adoption. You can mandate that your team uses video, but without automation and accountability, half your reps won't follow through.

Copilot fixes this. It assigns videos to team members, tracks completion, and reassigns if someone doesn't deliver. Your entire team stays consistent without you micromanaging every interaction.

### Enterprise (Custom Pricing)

Enterprise is for teams with 20+ users or organizations with strict security requirements. Everything from Core + Copilot, plus:
- Advanced security and compliance controls
- API access for custom integrations
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with SCIM provisioning via Okta
- Role-based access controls
- Advanced admin governance tools
- Enterprise-level analytics and reporting
- Dedicated onboarding and customer success manager

You'll need to talk to their sales team for pricing. Based on comparable SaaS tools, expect somewhere between $100-150 per user per month for teams of 20-50 people, with volume discounts for larger deployments.

## Finding BombBomb Promo Codes and Discounts

Let's talk about saving money, because nobody should pay full price if they don't have to.

**The 14-day free trial is your first move.** You get complete access to test the platform without entering a credit card. Use this time to actually build it into your workflow and measure results.

**Annual billing is the easiest discount.** As mentioned above, you automatically save 14-20% by committing to annual payment instead of monthly.

**Spring Reactivation Sale in March offers the biggest discount.** According to historical data, BombBomb typically runs a promotion in March with savings up to 40% off all subscription plans. If your subscription renewal is coming up in a different month, consider letting it lapse and reactivating during the March sale.

**Education and non-profit discounts are available.** If you work for a qualifying educational institution or non-profit organization, reach out to their sales team. They offer special pricing for these sectors but don't advertise the exact discount publicly.

**Historical promo codes include:** Some users report success with codes like "IS2315" (30% off), "IS2320", and "DLA30OFFBBP", though availability varies. Always check coupon sites before purchasing, but verify codes are current since many expire quickly.

The reality: BombBomb doesn't flood the market with promo codes like some SaaS companies. Their discounts tend to be seasonal or tied to specific events (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, back-to-school season).

Your best strategy is to sign up for their email list and follow them on social media to catch limited-time offers when they drop.

## Integration Hell (or Heaven, Depending on Your Stack)

BombBomb plays nicely with the tools you're already using, which matters if you don't want to rebuild your entire workflow.

**Gmail integration is seamless.** The BombBomb button appears right in your compose window. Click, record, send. No tab-switching or context-switching required.

**Outlook works the same way.** Whether you're using Outlook on desktop or web, the integration lets you record and send videos without leaving your inbox.

**CRM integrations keep your data synchronized.** BombBomb connects with Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Microsoft Dynamics, and Total Expert. Video activity (views, clicks, engagement) flows directly into your CRM timeline.

**Zapier unlocks unlimited possibilities.** Connect BombBomb to over 5,000 apps through Zapier. Trigger video sends based on form submissions. Log video engagement in Google Sheets. The automation options are endless.

**Mobile apps for on-the-go recording.** iOS and Android apps let you record and send videos from anywhere. The mobile experience is polished—pause and resume recording, switch between front and rear cameras, access your entire video library.

## What Users Actually Say About BombBomb

Real user reviews paint a more nuanced picture than marketing materials ever will.

**The good stuff people love:**
- The animated GIF preview makes emails impossible to ignore
- Gmail and Outlook integrations work flawlessly
- Tracking features provide valuable intelligence for follow-ups
- Customer support is responsive and helpful
- The platform is genuinely easy to use—even for non-technical users

**The stuff that frustrates people:**
- Pricing feels steep for occasional users
- Email template customization is limited without HTML knowledge
- Video editing features are basic compared to dedicated editing tools
- Some users report account freezes for suspected spam (usually resolved quickly by support)
- The mobile app focuses on individual videos, not mass campaign tracking

One real estate agent summarized it perfectly: "It's SO easy to use and thus far still rather unique so my video emails really help me to stand out! Honestly can't think of a thing as I've been so happy with it."

A business consultant had a different take: "I think it's overpriced for what it offers... I do appreciate the option to pause the subscription if needed."

The pattern is clear: people who integrate BombBomb into their daily workflow love it. People who use it sporadically feel the price doesn't justify limited usage.

## Who Should Actually Buy BombBomb?

Not everyone needs video messaging. Here's who benefits most:

**Sales teams in competitive markets.** If you're one of five companies bidding for the same client, video makes you memorable. You become the one who stood out.

**Real estate professionals.** This is BombBomb's bread and butter. Agents use it for listing updates, market reports, and staying top-of-mind with past clients. The results are proven.

**Mortgage brokers and financial advisors.** Complex products need explanation. Video communicates nuance and builds trust faster than any email could.

**Customer success managers.** Turn support tickets from frustrating text exchanges into personal conversations. Video reduces back-and-forth and increases customer satisfaction.

**Recruiters targeting passive candidates.** Elite talent gets hammered with generic outreach. A personalized video message from a recruiter makes candidates actually pay attention.

**Anyone who needs to explain complex concepts quickly.** If you're constantly typing the same explanation over and over, record it once as a video and reuse it.

Who should skip it? Solo consultants or freelancers who only send 2-3 videos per month. At $42/month minimum, you're paying $14-21 per video. That math doesn't work unless you're closing high-value deals.

## The Bottom Line: Is BombBomb Worth It?

Here's what it comes down to: BombBomb solves a specific problem exceptionally well.

If your business depends on building relationships through digital communication, video messaging isn't optional anymore—it's competitive advantage. BombBomb makes that easy enough that your entire team will actually use it.

The pricing is fair for teams who commit to using it consistently. The ROI calculation is straightforward: if video messaging helps you close even one additional deal per quarter, it pays for itself many times over.

The platform isn't perfect. Email customization could be better. Video editing is basic. But these are minor inconveniences compared to the core value: getting your face in front of prospects and customers faster than competitors who are still hiding behind text.

Start with the 14-day free trial. Don't just sign up and forget about it—actually commit to sending 3-5 videos per day during the trial period. Measure your response rates. Track the conversations that happen because someone watched your video.

If the results justify the investment, go annual to save 20%. If you're not seeing the value, cancel before the trial ends.

The companies killing it with BombBomb aren't using some secret strategy. They're just consistent. They show up as real humans instead of faceless corporations. They build trust faster. They close more deals.

That's the entire game.
